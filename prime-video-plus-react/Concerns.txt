Not doing the handson 
  Karthikeyan 
  Ibrahim  - is absent it seems. Check whether he is attending for attending sake.
  Bandesh - left the meeting today (Mon 4th Dec 2023) to attend another meeting. 
  Subhash - not doing the hands-on citing machine issue as reason.

  on Monday 4th Dec - many participants didn't attend the session.

  Jones - who was an active listener so far has today failed to showcase proper output.
