Database 
----
  * place to store data 
  * many types of databases 
    1. Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)
        Examples: Oracle, MySQL, MariaDB, MS SQL, PostgreSQL
        * data would be stored in tables 
        * tables will have fixed columns and rows 
        * suitable for structured data 
        * schema based
        * interact with db using Structured Query Language (SQL)

    2. NoSQL Databases (Not Only SQL)
        Examples: MongoDB, etc 
        * data would be stored in collections
        * collections will have documents made up of fields/keys and values
        * suitable for unstructured data
        * schema-less 
        * interact with MongoDB using JavaScript

  * databases will have 2 sides 
    1. Admin side (creating db, backing up, restoring) [NOT TO LEARN]
    2. Database Client side (creating data, managing data) [TO LEARN]

  * databases will have server and client 
  * database server should be running in some port number 
  * databases will be protected with db credentials (username and password)
  * to access the db, you need DB clients 
    1. Shell / Command Line Client [TO LEARN]
    2. GUI client 
        (MS SQL Server,  MySQL Workbench, PHPMyAdmin, SQLYog, HeidiSQL, Compass [TO LEARN], Robo 3T [TO LEARN])
    3. Programming Client [TO LEARN]

  CRUD Operations
  -----
    CREATE: Let's insert some data into users collection
      db.users.insert({name: "John"})
      db.users.insert({phone: 536475675, city: 'London'})
      db.users.insert({age: 20})
      db.users.insert({name: 'Steve', favCities: ["Toronto", "Amsterdam", "Kuala Lumpur"]})

    READ: Let's read the data from db collections 
      To find all documents 
        db.users.find()

      to fetch one document 
        db.users.find({age: 20}) // there may be many docs with age 20
        db.users.find({name: 'John'}) // there may be many docs with name John
        db.users.findOne({"_id" : ObjectId("657aa97344f78d81bda5bd77")})

    UPDATE: Let's update the data 
      db.users.updateOne( { name: "John" },
      {
        $set: {
          name: 'Steve',
          story: "A teenage girl risks everything–including her life–when she falls in love with a vampire."
        }
      })
